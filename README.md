A native PC port of _GoldenEye 007_ (Rare, 1997, Nintendo 64), compiled from
the [GoldenEye 007 decompilation](https://github.com/n64decomp/007): the
original N64 game running from reconstructed source, not the Xbox 360
remaster. The N64's graphics coprocessor (RSP) is emulated in software; every
other hardware surface (video, audio, input, timers, save storage) is shimmed
in a dedicated `port/` layer, following the architecture of the
[Perfect Dark PC port](https://github.com/fgsfdsfgs/perfect_dark), the same
Rare "Indy" engine family, one hardware generation apart.

**v0.4.0** (released 2026-09-28) is out for Windows and Linux (including
Steam Deck, where the Linux bundle sideloads as-is). It is the most complete
release to date: the full campaign runs at a steady 60 fps with the known
issues now few and mostly cosmetic ([Status](#status)). Free to download,
build on and modify (you bring the ROM).

**This is a pre-1.0 release, not a finished product.** v1.0 is the target
for a polished, feature-complete build; until then, expect missing features
and the occasional breaking change between versions. See [Status](#status)
for what works today and [Roadmap](#roadmap) for where this is headed.

**AI disclosure:** development here was agentic - Claude Pro plus a local
open-weight model on a single RTX 5090, as of August–September 2026. This
project is as much a study of *that process* as it is a port: whether
current LLMs can carry a codebase like this, and what actually goes wrong
along the way. Judge the result for yourself. I'm one person doing this in my
spare time, not a team. See [Background](#background) for the full setup,
timeline, and an honest account of what worked and what didn't.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **You must supply your own GoldenEye 007 ROM.** This repository contains no
> Nintendo code or assets, and no ROM. Nothing here is distributable as a
> playable game: see [Requirements](#requirements) and [Legal](#legal).

## Download

| Platform | Bundle | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Windows** (x86_64) | [win64.zip](https://github.com/jkdansereau/goldeneye-pc-port/releases) | Engine + runtime DLLs + the one-time asset tool. |
| **Linux** (x86_64) / **Steam Deck** | [linux tarball](https://github.com/jkdansereau/goldeneye-pc-port/releases) | SDL2 is bundled, so it runs as-is on any distro, and sideloads onto a Deck with nothing installed. |

Both bundles contain **no ROM and no game assets**: you supply your own
(see [Requirements](#requirements)), which keeps the release legal to
distribute. Earlier builds: v0.3.0, v0.2.2, v0.2.1, v0.2.0, and v0.1.0
alpha, same page. You can also build it yourself; see [Building](#building).

### Quick start

You need a GoldenEye 007 N64 ROM (`.z64`, big-endian). This release supports
the **NTSC-U (US)** version; PAL and JP are on the roadmap ([issue
#85](https://github.com/jkdansereau/goldeneye-pc-port/issues/85)). No ROM or game asset is
included or distributed. Then:

1. Download the Windows or Linux bundle from [Releases](https://github.com/jkdansereau/goldeneye-pc-port/releases) and unpack it.
2. Make a `data/` folder next to the executable and drop the ROM in as `ge007.ntsc-final.z64`.
3. Launch the executable from that folder. The first run takes a few extra seconds: it detects the ROM and generates the derived asset folders once (no Python or other tooling needed).

Read the [Status](#status) section first: the small number of known issues
in this release are listed plainly there.

---

## Status

**v0.4.0 - fully playable, with a small set of known caveats.** The full
single-player campaign is completable end to end (all 20 missions, Agent
difficulty, playtested), at a steady 60 fps; all 20 solo missions — plus
the end-of-campaign credits sequence — load, render and run crash-free,
verified on Windows, Linux and real Steam Deck hardware. The most common
defect classes from earlier releases — particle colour drift, water seams,
z-fighting, billboard trees, muzzle flashes, the front-end Nintendo logo,
gunshot SFX — are fixed in this version; what remains is a short list,
below. Feedback is very welcome.

What a release actually installs (no networking unless you use the opt-in
online multiplayer, no telemetry, no ROM or game assets shipped) and how
faithfully the port tracks the original N64 game's logic:
[Security & fidelity status](docs/security-and-fidelity-status.md).

**New in the source tree, not yet play-tested: online multiplayer.** Open
it with **F9**, or **Online** on the file-select screen.

- GoldenEye's 4-player multiplayer, with every player on their own PC and
  their own full-window view.
- Every scenario, stage and weapon set, and all 64 characters.
- Four ways to find a game:
  - the **online service**: quick match, a game list, and 6-character codes
    for private games;
  - LAN;
  - direct connect;
  - your own server.
- **The online service** is a free Cloudflare Worker that anyone can deploy
  ([`tools_pc/netplay/cloudflare`](tools_pc/netplay/cloudflare/README.md)).
  It only introduces the players and has a live web page of the games being
  played. The matches run directly between the players' PCs.
- It uses deterministic lockstep: only controller input travels.
- **Quick Match** finds a game that fits your preferences. You can set the
  mode (team modes included), map, weapons, length and number of players,
  or leave each as "any".
- **What is tested:** the network core, the service and the matchmaking are
  tested, including end to end on one PC. The network code is also fuzzed
  under AddressSanitizer against hostile hosts and joiners. **Not yet
  tested:** a real match in the game, and connecting across home routers.

How the netcode works: [Online multiplayer](#online-multiplayer). How to
play: [`docs/netplay.md`](docs/netplay.md). Design:
[`docs/dev/NETPLAY-PLAN.md`](docs/dev/NETPLAY-PLAN.md) and findings
D413 / D414 / D415 / D416.

**Working:** boot sequence and front end (menu → mission select → briefing →
start), front-end menu navigation on the left stick to match the F10 overlay
(D282); all 20 solo missions load, render and are crash-free (full campaign
playtested end to end at Agent difficulty, including the ending sequence); steady 60 fps
(software RSP off the presentation critical path); full audio: in-level music and SFX; keyboard + mouse (click-to-lock, an aim style of your
choice — N64 or centred FPS-style — with per-device sensitivity) and a modern
dual-stick controller layout (use/reload/weapon-cycle on A/X/Y, rumble-pak
vibration on supported pads); native widescreen at any aspect ratio
(undistorted world, HUD anchored to the screen edges, 4:3 menus pillarboxed);
in-game key rebinding (keyboard/mouse) with a GEPD-style default layout;
crosshair customization (opt-in); Bond is fixed in cutscenes (no more
floating or spin-glitching) and his third-person model positioning generally
is right the large majority of the time now, at most a small drift when off; file-backed saves; faithful N64 progression
by default (F10 → *All unlocked* opens every level, 007 mode and the full
cheat menu); F10 in-game options overlay (video, input, gameplay, HUD,
graphics, audio; frame cap, MSAA, filtering, FOV, sensitivity, key rebinding,
crosshair, vibration); Windows and
Linux, including Steam Deck.

**Known issues:**

- On Facility, if gas leaks during Ourumov's monologue he can pause for up to
  ~10 s before resuming the scripted shootout — a latent race that exists in
  the N64 original too (where it softlocks permanently); the port detects and
  auto-recovers it (D318).
- With native widescreen on, the F10 options overlay stretches with the
  window instead of pillarboxing like the front-end menus (legible; cosmetic;
  the F10 *Native widescreen* toggle restores the old stretched frame
  throughout). The world/HUD widescreen rendering itself is correct (D335b).
- The Rareware front-end logo shows a subtle texture-filtering artifact
  (Nintendo logo and legal page are clean). Cosmetic only (D75).
- This release ships NTSC (US) assets; PAL/JP ROMs are not supported in this
  version (D258).
- **`All unlocked` is experimental: back up `data/ge007.eep` before enabling
  it.** Any save while ON, even a profile-settings change, can permanently
  write artificial cheat unlocks and completion times into the EEPROM;
  switching OFF does not undo them (D387). Do not use it on a save whose
  original progression you need to preserve.
- Assorted further cosmetic defects are tracked in
  [`docs/dev/GRAPHICS-BACKLOG.md`](docs/dev/GRAPHICS-BACKLOG.md).
- No macOS or ARM support. Keyboard/mouse rebinding shipped in v0.4.0;
  controller-button rebinding is not supported yet.

Root causes and fix status for every item: the [release notes](https://github.com/jkdansereau/goldeneye-pc-port/releases)
and the finding log in [`docs/dev/findings.md`](docs/dev/findings.md).

### Steam Deck

The Linux bundle is the Deck build. SFTP it over from your PC, or download
it straight from the [releases page](https://github.com/jkdansereau/goldeneye-pc-port/releases) on the Deck itself:
extract, drop your ROM in `data/`, launch it once (the first run generates the
derived assets), and add the executable as a non-Steam game. SDL2 is bundled, so no dependencies need
installing. On SteamOS the first launch seeds `ge007.ini` with Deck-friendly
defaults: native 1280×800 fullscreen, VSync, 2× MSAA, and 250% draw/LOD
distance (the N64-authored fade distances read short on the close-up 7"
panel); everything is changeable in the options overlay and persists
afterwards. **Do that first launch in Game Mode, not Desktop Mode** — an ini
created by an earlier Desktop Mode launch (e.g. while testing before adding
it as a Steam shortcut) permanently skips the Deck preset, since any
existing ini always wins over it (D283). If your resolution isn't 1280×800
on first Game Mode boot, just set it manually: F10 → *Resolution*. The
renderer is CPU-bound (software RSP); expect original N64-era performance at
60 fps rather than more. This release was playtested on real Deck hardware;
the v0.1.0-era Facility crash (D203) did not recur: its root cause was
identified and fixed (D253), and a separate intermittent SIGSEGV in heavy
firefights/terminal destruction (D255) and an audio-thread crash (D305) are
both fixed and live-verified on real hardware as of this release.

**In-game settings on the Deck.** The options overlay is fully gamepad-driven:
it opens with **Select**, the D-pad or left stick (up/down) moves between
options, **A** steps the selected option forward, **B** steps it back, and
**Start** (or Select again) closes. Toggles flip, resolution / MSAA /
filtering cycle, sliders step in increments. With a keyboard attached the same
overlay is `F10` + arrows/Enter.

## Roadmap

No fixed timeline or committed feature list — this is spare-time work — but
directionally, on the way to v1.0:

- Working through the [known issues](#status) above and the fuller list in
  [`docs/dev/findings.md`](docs/dev/findings.md).
- **PAL and JP ROM support** ([issue #85](https://github.com/jkdansereau/goldeneye-pc-port/issues/85)); NTSC-U is the only supported region today.
- **Controller (pad) button rebinding UI** (keyboard/mouse rebinding shipped
  in v0.4.0), and macOS/ARM builds.
- **Online multiplayer** (online service, LAN, direct and own-server play,
  each player on their own PC): first implementation in the tree, with a
  public online service running ([Online multiplayer](#online-multiplayer)).
  Next:
  - real-match and home-router testing;
  - a relay fallback for routers that can't be hole-punched;
  - a full-height 2-player view;
  - MP cheats in the lobby.
- General polish: performance, remaining rendering/audio defects, save/config
  robustness.

Not currently planned: new game modes GE never shipped (e.g. co-op), ray
tracing. If any of these matter to you, open an issue — it helps
prioritize.

---

## Beyond playing

- **Tweak it**: `ge007.ini` and the F10 in-game overlay expose resolution,
  frame cap, MSAA, texture filtering, FOV/draw distance, mouse feel, key
  rebinding, crosshair and vibration; launch with `-fresh` for a clean-slate
  run.
- **Read it**: [`docs/internals.md`](docs/internals.md) maps the
  architecture and the software RSP; [`docs/porting-notes.md`](docs/porting-notes.md)
  is the catalogue of N64→PC bug classes hit along the way. Game logic in
  `src/` is unmodified decompilation; every hardware surface lives in the
  MIT-licensed `port/` layer.
- **Mod it**: the port layer, build system and `tools_pc/` are yours to
  extend (see [License](#license)); [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) has
  the ground rules for getting changes in, and [`docs/dev/`](docs/dev/) is
  the raw engineering record behind every fix.

---

## Background

The port was built by two coding agents, a local open-weight model
(`unsloth/Qwen3.8-27B-GGUF` on one RTX 5090, via the [pi](https://pi.dev/)
agent) doing the groundwork (build, boot chain, software-RSP integration,
asset pipeline, first frames), and **Claude Code** (Sonnet 5, Opus 5 for the
hardest bugs) joining for the collaborative phase (the 21-level sweep, the
ABI finding catalog, SDL input, front end), handing work back and forth
through shared written notes, directed by one person part-time. In short:
43 days (16 Aug – 28 Sep), 1005 commits, 286 findings root-caused and logged
(`D1`–`D408`).

## How this differs from the other GoldenEye PC projects

This is a native port of the original 1997 Nintendo 64 game, built from its
actual reconstructed source code, the same lineage as the Perfect Dark PC
port. The other well-known "GoldenEye on PC" projects are something
different: they machine-translate the shipped binary of the *unreleased Xbox
360 XBLA remaster*, a different game on a different codebase with no shared
code with this one.

| | This project | The other well-known "GoldenEye on PC" recompilation projects (and their Steam Deck builds) |
|---|---|---|
| **What it ports** | The original **Nintendo 64** game (1997) | The **Xbox 360 XBLA** HD remaster (built ~2007, never released) |
| **How** | Decompilation-based source port: human-reconstructed C, compiled for the host; game logic runs as written | Static binary recompilation: the shipped machine code is auto-translated to C; no source-level understanding |
| **Lineage** | [GoldenEye 007 decompilation](https://github.com/n64decomp/007) + [Perfect Dark PC port](https://github.com/fgsfdsfgs/perfect_dark) engine family | Xbox 360 "…Recompiled" static-recompilation family |
| **Renderer** | Software RSP → OpenGL | Hardware (Vulkan) |
| **Status** | v0.4.0 public release; full campaign playable at 60 fps (see [Status](#status)) | Playable full game |
| **Why it exists** | To run the *original* N64 game from source, and as a [case study in AI-agent collaboration](#background) on a hard low-level codebase | To get a playable PC release of the remaster |

They answer a different question: how to get the *remaster* onto PC by
machine translation. This project answers how to get the *original 1997
game* onto PC, running from its reconstructed source.

## Requirements

You need a GoldenEye 007 (Nintendo 64) ROM that you legally own, in
big-endian (`.z64`) format, matching one of:

| Region | ROMID | ROM filename (in `data/`) | SHA-1 |
|--------|-------|---------------------------|-------|
| NTSC-U (US)  | `ntsc-final` | `ge007.ntsc-final.z64` | `abe01e4aeb033b6c0836819f549c791b26cfde83` |
| PAL (EU)     | `pal-final`  | `ge007.pal-final.z64`  | `167c3c433dec1f1eb921736f7d53fac8cb45ee31` |
| NTSC-J (JP)  | `jpn-final`  | `ge007.jpn-final.z64`  | `2a5dade32f7fad6c73c659d2026994632c1b3174` |

This release supports the US (NTSC-U) version; PAL and JP ROMs are
recognised by region but not yet supported (on the roadmap, [issue
#85](https://github.com/jkdansereau/goldeneye-pc-port/issues/85)).

The port also relies on the decompilation's asset-extraction step, which pulls
the level, model, texture and music data out of your ROM at build time. That
step, too, requires your ROM and is part of [Building](#building).

---

## Building

Prerequisites: CMake >= 3.16, a C/C++ toolchain, SDL2, zlib, OpenGL, Python 3,
plus the decompilation's own build dependencies (an IRIX MIPS toolchain via
`qemu-irix`, used only for the one-time asset extraction). See
[`docs/building.md`](docs/building.md) for the full walkthrough and the
asset-extraction details.

### Windows (MSYS2)

```sh
# in the MINGW64 shell
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2 \
          mingw-w64-x86_64-zlib mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake \
          mingw-w64-x86_64-python make git

git clone https://github.com/jkdansereau/goldeneye-pc-port.git
cd goldeneye-pc-port
# 1. extract assets from your ROM (see docs/building.md)
# 2. build the port
./build-pc.sh ntsc-final         # NTSC-U; PAL/JP engine builds compile, but their asset sidecars are not yet producible (issue #85)
```

### Linux

The Linux build is compiled on every push by CI (ubuntu-24.04); the release
bundle additionally bundles SDL2 so no system packages are needed at runtime.

```sh
sudo apt install build-essential cmake python3 libsdl2-dev zlib1g-dev libgl1-mesa-dev
git clone https://github.com/jkdansereau/goldeneye-pc-port.git
cd goldeneye-pc-port
# extract assets (docs/building.md), then:
./build-pc.sh ntsc-final
```

The executable is written to `build-pc/ge007.x86_64` (on Windows,
`build-pc/ge007.x86_64.exe`).

---

## Running

1. Create a `data/` directory in the repo root.
2. Put your ROM in it, named as in the table above
   (e.g. `data/ge007.ntsc-final.z64`).
3. Run the executable from the repo root:
   `./build-pc/ge007.x86_64`.

Configuration is written to `ge007.ini` on first run; game progress
lives in `ge007.eep`. Launch with `-fresh` to wipe both before starting
(a clean-slate run for playtesting).

### Default controls

| Action              | Keyboard / mouse         | Controller    |
|---------------------|--------------------------|---------------|
| Move / strafe       | `W` `A` `S` `D` / arrows  | Left stick (or D-pad) |
| Aim / look          | Mouse                    | Right stick   |
| Fire                | Left mouse               | Right trigger |
| Aim mode            | Right mouse / `LShift`   | Left trigger / LB |
| Use / interact      | `E`                       | A             |
| Reload              | `R`                       | X             |
| Crouch              | `LCtrl`                   | Left or right stick click |
| Cycle owned gadgets | Watch inventory          | B             |
| Next weapon         | Mouse wheel down / `Q`   | Y             |
| Previous weapon     | Mouse wheel up           | —             |
| Start               | `Enter` / `Tab`          | Start         |
| Options overlay     | `F10`                    | Select (A toggles/steps; B backs; D-pad/stick adjusts sliders; Start closes) |
| Online multiplayer  | `F9` ([guide](docs/netplay.md)) | — (once open: D-pad / A / B / Start) |

The default layout is the GEPD-style preset on the keyboard and the standard
dual-stick scheme on controllers (left stick move, right stick look,
triggers fire/aim, A use, X reload, B gadget cycle, Y weapon cycle, stick
click crouch). The watch gadget cycle selects the next owned gadget in the
N64 inventory. The controller layout matches Rare's Xbox 1.1 (Jinx) button
roles (user-tested on a physical pad; D394), and the remaining Xbox schemes
(1.2 Christmas, 1.3 Frost, 1.4 Elektra) are planned as selectable presets
and not yet available. Keyboard → Bindings edits **keyboard/mouse only**; a
controller can navigate those pages and use B to go back, but
controller-button rebinding is not supported yet.

Mouse sensitivity, Y-inversion and the aim/turn split are tunable in the
F10 overlay (*Keyboard → Sensitivity*) or the `[Input]` section of
`ge007.ini`.

---

## How it works

The R4300 game code in `src/` is compiled completely unmodified; the
decompilation's control flow is ground truth. Everything that would touch N64
hardware is redirected into `port/`: a **software RSP** (`port/fast3d/`,
adapted from the Perfect Dark port) that interprets the GBI display list the
game builds each frame and emits OpenGL, bypassing the RDP; a scheduler
replacement (`port/src/gesched.c`) that drives it directly; single-threaded
libultra OS shims (`port/src/libultra.c`); and SDL2/OpenGL/filesystem backends
for video, audio, input and storage. The 32→64-bit transition forces a small,
cataloged class of mechanical ABI-only edits to ROM-serialized structs
(pointer-width reconciliation); these change no behavior and are documented
individually. Where it diverges from the Perfect Dark port: GoldenEye's N64
serialized asset formats are converted offline by Python "sidecar" converters
in `tools_pc/` rather than fixed up at load time. Full detail:
[`docs/internals.md`](docs/internals.md) and
[`docs/porting-notes.md`](docs/porting-notes.md).

## Online multiplayer

Up to four players, each on their own PC with their own full-window view,
playing GoldenEye's multiplayer over LAN or the internet. It is new in the
source tree and not yet play-tested; see [Status](#status). How to play:
[`docs/netplay.md`](docs/netplay.md).

### Deterministic lockstep

GoldenEye's simulation is deterministic. The same starting state and the same
controller input give the same game, frame for frame. So the PCs never
exchange game state: every PC runs the complete, unmodified game, and only
controller input crosses the network.

- **Input bundles.** Each frame, every PC samples its own player's input for
  frame *f + D* and sends it to the host. The host gathers one input per
  player per frame into a **bundle** and relays the bundles to everyone. A PC
  plays frame *f* only once it holds bundle *f*, so every PC feeds the game
  the same input in the same order.
- **Input delay.** *D* is chosen per match from the measured ping:
  the slowest round trip in 60 Hz frames, plus 2, at most 12 frames
  (200 ms). It can also be set in the lobby. The delay hides network
  latency. A late bundle pauses the game briefly rather than letting PCs
  diverge, and a waiting screen shows who is holding things up.
- **Desync check.** Every 30 frames each PC sends a hash of its state. The
  host compares them and tells everyone the frame where they diverged.
- **Dropouts.** If a player disconnects, or stops sending input for 15 s,
  the host switches that player to neutral input from the same frame on
  every PC, and the match carries on for the others.

### The same start on every PC

Netplay adds one `#ifdef PORT` call to the game's code: `netgameOnStageLoad`
in `src/boss.c`, at the top of the per-stage loop, before the stage's first
random number. It does nothing outside a network match. When a match starts
it:

- writes everything the game's own RAMROM demo system treats as a stage's
  starting state: seeds, the agreed multiplayer setup, save options and
  cheats;
- installs the controller playback hook (`joySetPlaybackFunc`, the seam the
  game uses to play back demos);
- switches the game's clock to frame-locked time, so no wall-clock value
  reaches the simulation.

Port settings that would change which game code runs, such as the aspect
ratio, control style and aim settings, are pinned for the match.

### Your own view, PC controls

- **One view per PC.** Every PC still simulates and renders every player's
  view, because the game interleaves simulation with each player's render
  pass. It presents only its own player, scaled to the full window; the
  other views are skipped before any GL work (`port/fast3d/gfx_pc.cpp`).
- **PC controls.** Mouse look, the GEPD-style crosshair, free crouch, and
  the dedicated reload and gadget buttons travel in the input record and are
  replayed on every PC (`port/src/input.c`), so PC-style aiming works
  online.

### Network layer (`port/net/`)

- **Self-contained.** Plain C11 over UDP, with no game code: the host, the
  matchmaking server and the self-test build without the game.
- **Session layer.** Each peer connection carries reliable, ordered messages
  (lobby, match start) alongside unreliable ones (input, bundles), plus a
  keepalive and round-trip measurement.
- **Same build only.** Only identical builds play together: the same version,
  ROM region, platform and protocol.
- **No amplification.** Join requests are padded to 256 bytes, larger than
  any reply, so a host can't be used to amplify traffic.

### Finding a game

There are four ways to connect:

- **the online service;**
- **LAN,** found by a broadcast on the local network;
- **direct connect,** where the host forwards UDP port 27007;
- **your own server** (`ge007-netserver`). It carries the game traffic, so
  it works behind any router.

The **online service** (`tools_pc/netplay/cloudflare`) is a Cloudflare
Worker with one Durable Object, on the free tier. It provides the game list,
6-letter game codes, Quick Match and a live status page. It only introduces
players, and matches never pass through it:

1. The game learns its public address from Cloudflare's STUN server.
2. The service hands each side the other's addresses.
3. The host and the joiner punch through their routers towards each other
   (UDP hole punching).

**Quick Match** puts a searcher into an open game that fits their
preferences: mode (team modes included), map, weapons, length and players,
each of which can be "any". Games are ordered as follows:

1. games nobody has failed to reach;
2. then games on the searcher's continent;
3. then the fullest;
4. then the oldest.

If no game fits, the searcher hosts one with their preferences as its rules.
An unreachable game is skipped quietly, and after three the searcher hosts.
Quick games start once everyone is ready: after 12 s with two players, 8 s
with three, and 3 s when full.

### Hardening

Every peer is untrusted.

- **Game side:**
  - every packet is bounds-checked;
  - every value the game will index a table with is range-checked;
  - all text is forced to printable ASCII;
  - input floats are made finite and bounded (the game's angle-wrap loop
    would never finish on an infinite value).
- **The service:**
  - a player may only publish their own public address, so it can't be used
    to aim traffic at anyone;
  - lobby tokens are signed;
  - match results are accepted only for matches the service saw;
  - there are per-address and edge rate limits;
  - it is HTTPS only.
- **Fuzzing:** `tools_pc/netplay/netfuzz.c` attacks the real code under
  AddressSanitizer with hostile hosts, hostile joiners, tampered packets and
  garbage. The service has its own fuzz tests.

### Testing

- **`netplay_selftest`** plays whole lockstep matches on a simulated network
  (loss, duplication, 20–200 ms latency). It checks that every client gets
  byte-identical input and the same state on every frame. It also covers
  desyncs, disconnects, aborts, rematches, a normal match end, matchmaking,
  STUN and the online-service protocol.
- **The service** has unit tests, an integration test against the game's
  service client, and an end-to-end test with the real network runtime (one
  process per player, plus a fake STUN server).
- **Not yet tested:** a real match in the game, and connecting across real
  home routers.

### Where the code is

```
port/net/                    sockets, wire protocol, session layer, host / client,
                             lockstep relay, STUN, online-service client
port/src/netgame.c           game glue: match start, playback hook, waiting screen

## Credits

This port is a thin layer on a large amount of other people's work.

**Prior work it is built on**

- The [GoldenEye 007 decompilation](https://github.com/n64decomp/007), years of
  effort by Larry Ficken ("kholdfuzion") and the project's contributors; plus
  zoinkity's GoldenEye documentation, which the decomp started from. This port
  is a fork of that repository.
- The [Perfect Dark PC port](https://github.com/fgsfdsfgs/perfect_dark)
  (Ryan Dwyer and contributors), the reference architecture for this port and
  the source of the `fast3d` software RSP.
- The [Perfect Dark decompilation](https://github.com/n64decomp/perfect_dark),
  the sibling decomp the PD port is built on.
- **Carnivorous**: author of the *Mouse Injector* input plugin for 1964 (the
  "GEPD Edition" bundle). Its mouse-aim behaviour for GoldenEye/Perfect Dark is
  what the in-game GEPD-style aim mode is modelled on; the implementation here
  is an independent reimplementation of that behaviour, not derived code.
  Thanks also to **Rice** and **schibo** of the 1964 team for the emulator it
  shipped with.

**Vendored / adapted code**

- `port/fast3d/`: the software RSP, adapted from the PD port. It originates
  with the [Ship of Harkinian](https://github.com/HarbourMasters) /
  libultraship fast3d (© Emill, MaikelChan; MIT, see `port/fast3d/LICENSE.txt`),
  which itself descends from
  [sm64-port](https://github.com/sm64-port/sm64-port)'s fast3d and audio mixer.
- `port/fast3d/glad/`: OpenGL loader generated by
  [glad](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad) (David Herberth, MIT).
- The decompilation toolchain: [`ido-static-recomp`](https://github.com/decompals/ido-static-recomp)
  (Emill / decompals), [`qemu-irix`](https://github.com/n64decomp/qemu-irix) and
  `rabbitizer` (n64decomp).
- [SDL2](https://libsdl.org) and [zlib](https://zlib.net).

**Methodology**

- Chris Lewis, [*"Decompiling a Nintendo 64 Game in 84 Days"*](https://blog.chrislewis.au/decompiling-a-nintendo-64-game-in-84-days/) (the Snowboard
  Kids decompilation write-up), the agent-workflow practices in
  [`docs/dev-process.md`](docs/dev-process.md) are adapted from it.

**Consultation**

- **f1zz1ec0ke** ([GitHub](https://github.com/f1zz1ec0ke)): LLM consultation on model
  tuning, agent harnesses, and agentic strategy throughout the port's development.

**Tools and models used to develop the port**

- Qwen 3.8 (Alibaba Qwen team), run locally from the
  [`unsloth/Qwen3.8-27B-GGUF`](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen3.8-27B-GGUF)
  repo — `UD-Q4_K_XL` as the primary quant, with other quants used along the
  way; [Unsloth](https://unsloth.ai) (the GGUF quantisation and Unsloth
  Desktop) as the local model server.
- [pi](https://pi.dev/): the local coding-agent harness.
- [Claude / Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) (Anthropic).

## Legal

This is a non-commercial fan preservation/research project, in the same
category as the many other N64 decompilation and native-port repositories on
GitHub. It follows the same conventions they do:

- **No ROM and no game assets are distributed**: not in this repository and
  not in any release. Textures, audio, models, level data and in-game text are
  extracted from a ROM *you already own*, on *your* machine, at build time.
- The repository is a fork of the public
  [GoldenEye 007 decompilation](https://github.com/n64decomp/007) and inherits
  its contents unmodified (see [`NOTICE`](NOTICE) for what that includes).
- No official logos, box art, or marketing assets are used. "GoldenEye 007",
  "007", "James Bond" and related marks belong to their respective owners
  (Nintendo, Microsoft/Rare, MGM, Danjaq, EON Productions).
- Pre-built binaries published under [Releases](https://github.com/jkdansereau/goldeneye-pc-port/releases) contain
  only the engine (the `port/` layer plus the compiled decompilation, with no
  game data of any kind), bundled with permissively-licensed runtime libraries
  (SDL2, zlib, the MinGW runtime; their licenses travel in the download). Any
  build, yours or ours, is useless without a ROM you supply.

This project is **not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by** Nintendo,
Rare, Microsoft, MGM, Danjaq, EON Productions, or any rights holder in
GoldenEye or James Bond. If you are a rights holder with a concern, open an
issue and it will be addressed.

## License

The original work in this repository, the port layer (`port/`), the PC build
system, `tools_pc/`, and the documentation, is released under the MIT License;

is covered by [`NOTICE`](NOTICE), not by that license.
